Title: About me

I'm a PhD candidate at Radboud University Nijmegen (RUN), The Netherlands. I
work on building multi-modal interactive electronic health records to improve
patient understanding. This PhD project is housed under [AI for
Health](https://ai-for-health.nl).

I obtained my Master's degree in Data Science at the RUN in 2019.
