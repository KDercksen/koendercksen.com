#### Abstract
Nowadays, clinical patients are often free to access their own electronic
health records (EHRs) online. Medical records are however not written with the
patient in mind -- the medical terminology necessary to ensure unambiguous
communication between medical professionals on likelihood of pathology renders
the EHRs less accessible to patients. By annotating these texts with links to
external knowledge bases, the patients can be provided with additional reliable
information to clarify terminology.  In this paper, we present preliminary work
on preparing Dutch radiology reports for named entity recognition and entity
linking to provide additional information to patients. Additionally, we suggest
a roadmap for further research into patient-friendly presentation of radiology
reports.
